# Pristine internal data model refactor — progress

## Overall status

**Status:** In progress (Phase 0 scaffolding)

The model refactor is delivered as a **phased epic**. Each phase is a self-contained subplan, executed by a **separate agent session**, on its own branch + PR, merged to `main` **sequentially** before the next phase branches.

---

## Delivery model (read this first if you are a new agent)

1. One phase at a time. Do **not** start a phase until the previous phase's PR is merged to `main`.
2. Each phase branches `{ticket}/paddy/{slug}` from **`origin/main`** (latest).
3. Generate the phase's subplan first (use [make-a-plan](../../../.cursor/skills/make-a-plan/SKILL.md) in plan mode), then execute it.
4. Commit atomically as you go (per [git-workflow](../../../.cursor/skills/git-workflow/SKILL.md)); never batch into one end-of-phase commit.
5. **Update this file and the outstanding file at every checkpoint and before opening each PR.** This is the primary handoff channel between agent sessions.
6. Keep the OpenGD77/1701 import → edit → export → re-import round-trip green every phase.

## Carry-over state (update at the end of every phase)

The next agent relies on these values. Keep them accurate.

- **Current `CODEPLUG_SCHEMA_VERSION`:** 3 (no bump landed yet)
- **Last merged phase:** none
- **`main` is at:** (commit/PR after last merge) — N/A yet
- **Epic ticket:** [#93](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-tool/issues/93). No per-phase child tickets — FK-by-UUID and provenance/rename are folded under #93.
- **New tickets created in Phase 0:**
  - OpenGD77 export issues (tracking): [#95](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-tool/issues/95)
- **Shared test builders:** not created yet (planned Phase 2 at `src/test/builders`)
- **Provenance `meta` shape:** not designed yet (Phase 3) — Phase 4 (FK-by-UUID) depends on it
- **`vendorExtras` renamed to `opengd77Extras`?** No (Phase 3)

### Locked design decisions (do not relitigate)

- Epic with per-phase subplans/PRs, sequential to `main`.
- Dual-kind FK = discriminated ref `{ kind: 'talkGroup' | 'contact'; id }`; `TalkGroup` and `Contact` stay separate entities.
- `vendorExtras` → `opengd77Extras`; recurring extras may be promoted to first-class fields.
- `scanSkip` is first-class; `zoneSkip` stays an OpenGD77 extra.
- Field types per section 2 of the review doc: frequencies as integer **Hz**; `power`/`squelch` as percent with `null` = master; tones as a CTCSS/DCS string enum; `colourCode`/`timeslot`/`dmrId`/`transmitTimeout` nullable numbers/enums; `rxOnly` boolean.
- `Channel.number` removed from the model; assigned at OpenGD77 export.
- `aprsConfigName` stays a string FK until APRS is modelled.
- Vendor limits (e.g. zone member cap) belong at export only — never in model/mutations/validation/CRUD.

## Phase 0 — Audit close-out, new tickets, scaffold (#91)

**Status:** Complete (pending merge)
**Branch:** `91/paddy/data-model-vendor-agnostic-review`
**PR:** [#94](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-tool/pull/94) (Closes #91)

**Delivered**

- [vendor-agnostic-review.md](vendor-agnostic-review.md) (`74c4293`) + refined field types (`05f9142`).
- These tracking docs created (`62b39fe`).
- OpenGD77 export-issues tracker created: [#95](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-tool/issues/95).
- Fixed stale schema version in [persistence README](../persistence/README.md) (v1 → 3).

**Verify**

- Docs-only; no code changed.
- Tracking docs linked from [docs/features/README.md](../README.md) and the epic plan.

## Phase 1 — Drop `Channel.number` (#53)

**Status:** Not started
**Branch:** `53/paddy/drop-channel-number` (from `origin/main` after Phase 0 merges)

---

## Phase 2 — Typed channel fields + shared test builders (#52)

**Status:** Not started
**Branch:** `52/paddy/typed-channel-fields`

---

## Phase 3 — Import provenance to per-entity `meta` + `opengd77Extras` rename (new ticket)

**Status:** Not started
**Branch:** `{ticket}/paddy/import-provenance-meta`

---

## Phase 4 — FKs by UUID, discriminated refs (new ticket)

**Status:** Not started
**Branch:** `{ticket}/paddy/fk-by-uuid`
**Prerequisite:** Phase 3 provenance `meta` shape merged.

---

## Next

- Finish Phase 0: create the three tickets, fix the persistence doc, open the PR closing #91.
- Then generate the Phase 1 subplan in a fresh session and execute it.
