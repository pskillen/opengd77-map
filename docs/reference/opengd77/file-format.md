# OpenGD77 CSV — file format rules

Cross-cutting wire-format rules for all OpenGD77 CPS CSV files. Per-file column tables live in sibling docs.

## Header-name parsing

- Columns are matched by **header name**, not column index. CPS export order may vary; adapters must not hard-code positions.
- The first row is the header row — do not modify header text when round-tripping.
- Canonical header spellings live in [`src/lib/import/opengd77/columns.ts`](../../../src/lib/import/opengd77/columns.ts) and per-file reference docs.
- UTF-8 BOM at file start is stripped on import.
- Leading **tab** characters in cell values are stripped on channel import (CPS uses tabs to force spreadsheet text mode for frequencies).

## Name-based foreign keys

OpenGD77 CPS builds internal indexes from **exact name matches** across files. Typos or case changes silently break links at CPS import — our adapters preserve names for export round-trip.

| From | Column(s) | References |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Channels.csv` | `Contact` | `Contacts.csv` → `Contact Name` |
| `Channels.csv` | `TG List` | `TG_Lists.csv` → `TG List Name` |
| `TG_Lists.csv` | `Contact1`…`ContactN` | `Contacts.csv` → `Contact Name` |
| `Zones.csv` | `Channel1`…`ChannelN` | `Channels.csv` → `Channel Name` |

Matching is **case-sensitive**. Renaming a channel requires updating every zone reference; renaming a contact requires updating channels and TG list members.

Member column **count** (`ChannelN`, `ContactN`) is radio-profile-specific — see [radios/](radios/README.md).

## Internal vs vendor fields

At the vendor boundary:

- `Channel.name`, `Channel.contactName`, `Channel.rxGroupListName` are **wire/display names**, not internal relationship keys.
- Internal models use stable UUIDs (`Channel.id`, `Zone.memberChannelIds`, …).
- `Zone.sourceMemberNames` and `RxGroupList.sourceMemberNames` preserve imported vendor names for export and unresolved-member reporting.
- `Channel.vendorExtras` holds OpenGD77-only columns not mapped to first-class model fields (see [channels.md](channels.md)).

## Boolean and enum conversion

| Wire pattern | Internal | Import | Export |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Yes` / `No` (case-insensitive on import) | `boolean` | `parseYesNo` | `wireYesNo` → `Yes` / `No` |
| `Off` / non-empty VOX | `voxEnabled: boolean` | `Off` or empty → `false`; any other non-empty → `true` | `wireVoxEnabled` → `Off` / `On` |
| `Group` / `Private` (`ID Type`) | `TalkGroup` / `Contact` | case-insensitive `group` check | `Group` / `Private` |
| `Analogue` / `Digital` | `ChannelMode` | see [channel-modes.md](../channel-modes.md) | lossy collapse to `Analogue` / `Digital` |

Most other fields are stored and round-tripped as **strings** without normalisation (frequencies, tones, power levels, `Rx Only`, etc.).

## Round-trip tiers

| Tier | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lossless** | Parsed to typed/boolean model fields and serialised back | `All Skip` ↔ `scanSkip`, `VOX`, `Use Location`, `Channel Type` for FM/DMR |
| **String pass-through** | Stored as string; export writes stored value | Frequencies, tones, `Rx Only`, `Contact`, `TG List` |
| **vendorExtras** | Stored in `Channel.vendorExtras[header]` | `Zone Skip`, `No Beep`, `No Eco`, `TS1_TA_Tx`, `TS2_TA_Tx ID` |
| **Lossy** | Internal richness not representable on wire | Specific modes (`ysf`, `am`, …) collapse to `Analogue`/`Digital` — see [channel-modes.md](../channel-modes.md) |
| **Header-only** | Export includes headers; body not modelled | `DTMF.csv`, `APRS.csv` (except channel `APRS` name) |
| **Not imported** | File skipped entirely on import | `DTMF.csv`, `APRS.csv` today |

## Locale and line endings

Per G4EML CPS documentation and forum guidance:

- Delimiter follows Windows locale: comma (`,`) or semicolon (`;`).
- Decimal separator in frequencies may be `.` or `,`.
- CPS auto-detects format on import; do not change delimiter style unless re-importing on the same locale.
- Some CPS versions require **CRLF** line endings; Mac-style CR-only exports may fail CPS import (forum reports).

Our browser parser accepts standard comma-separated CSV as exported by the CPS on typical UK/US locales.

## Export-time radio profiles

Cardinality limits (max channels, zone member slots, TG list member slots, name display length) and feature availability (APRS configs, DTMF, airband) **diverge by radio or radio family**. These belong in [radio profiles](radios/README.md), not in generic column tables.

Intended architecture:

1. Operator edits a **radio-agnostic** codeplug in the app.
2. At export, operator selects a **radio profile** (e.g. Baofeng 1701).
3. Exporter applies profile limits (truncate/pad member columns, validate counts) while serialising generic wire columns.

Today's shipped exporter uses [Baofeng 1701](radios/baofeng-1701.md) constants (80 zone members, 32 TG list members) without a profile picker.

## App import requirements vs CPS

Our channel parser requires header columns `Channel Name`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude` to be **present** (CPS always exports them). Rows without a channel name are skipped. Rows with invalid or missing lat/lon get `location: null`.

This is stricter than "channels without map coordinates" in some hand-edited CSVs — missing header columns throw a parse error.
