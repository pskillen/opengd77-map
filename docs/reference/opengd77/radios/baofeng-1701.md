# Baofeng 1701 / Retevis RT-84 — OpenGD77 profile

Radio profile for the **Baofeng DM-1701** (also sold as **Retevis RT-84**) running OpenGD77 firmware. This is the **first documented profile** and matches today's shipped import/export adapter constants.

**Hardware family:** TYT MD-UV380 / Retevis RT-3S / Baofeng DM-1701 / Retevis RT-84 (shared OpenGD77 CPS and codeplug format).

## Capacity and cardinality

| Constraint | Value | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Max channels | 1023 | G4EML CPS | `Channel Number` unique integer 1–1023; gaps allowed |
| Zone members | 80 | CPS export / adapter | `Channel1`…`Channel80` |
| TG list members | 32 | CPS export / adapter | `Contact1`…`Contact32` |
| Contacts | ~100+ | CPS / operator practice | No hard app limit today |
| Channel name display | ~16 chars | CPS UI | Longer names may truncate on radio LCD |
| TOT range | 0–495, step 15 | G4EML CPS | `0` = off |
| Colour code | 0–15 | G4EML CPS | Digital channels |
| Append CSV renumber | Ignores channel numbers | G4EML CPS | Append mode compacts and renumbers sequentially |

## Feature availability

| Feature | 1701 support | App modelling | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DMR digital | Yes | Full | `Channel Type` = `Digital` |
| Analogue FM | Yes | Full | `Channel Type` = `Analogue`; no dual-mode row |
| Promiscuous RX (TG lists) | Yes | Full | `TG List` on channel + `TG_Lists.csv` |
| APRS | Yes (firmware) | **Partial** | `Channels.APRS` name round-trips; `APRS.csv` body not modelled |
| DTMF sequences | Yes (firmware) | **Not modelled** | `DTMF.csv` exported header-only |
| Hotspot / talkaround | Yes | vendorExtras | `TS1_TA_Tx`, `TS2_TA_Tx ID` in vendorExtras |
| Airband / AM | **No** | N/A | OpenGD77 on 1701 does not carry AM airband — layout convention |
| YSF / D-STAR / M17 | No native CPS columns | Lossy export | Collapse to `Digital` if set in internal model |

## Layout conventions (1701)

These are operator/layout choices, not CSV column differences:

- **Lean model** — one channel row per repeater/site, not one row per repeater×talk-group; promiscuous TG lists handle RX.
- **Zone = scan** — no separate scan-list file; zone member order is scan order.
- **No dual mode** — FM+DMR repeater needs separate `Analogue` and `Digital` rows.
- **Naming** — callsign + qualifier (e.g. `GB7GL Glasgow`); case-sensitive FKs across files.
- **Independent TX TG** — on the radio, RF channel and TX talk group are independently selectable (behaviour not stored in CSV).

## Adapter calibration notes

Profile selection is implemented at import and export via `src/lib/opengd77/profiles.ts`:

| Profile id | Zone members | TG members | Max channels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `opengd77-1701` | 80 | 32 | 1023 |
| `opengd77-md9600` | 80 | 32 | 1023 |

## Power ladder (P-index → percent)

| Wire | Watts (1701) | Percent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `P9` | 5 W | 100 |
| `P8` | 4 W | 80 |
| `P7` | 3 W | 60 |
| `P6` | 2 W | 40 |
| `P5` | 1 W | 20 |
| `P4` | 750 mW | 15 |
| `P3` | 500 mW | 10 |
| `P2` | 250 mW | 5 |
| `P1` | 50 mW | 1 |
| `Master` | radio default | `null` |

Squelch wire is profile-independent: `N%`, `Disabled` → 0%, `Master` → `null`.

## Known gaps vs generic reference

| Topic | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `Zone Skip` vs `All Skip` | `All Skip` → `scanSkip`; `Zone Skip` in vendorExtras only |
| `Rx Only` normalisation | Stored as raw string, not `Yes`/`No` boolean |
| Unresolved zone members | Preserved in `sourceMemberNames`; no import warning UI |
| Other OpenGD77 radios | Limits assumed same as 1701 until validated — file issues when exports differ |
