# TYT MD-9600 / Retevis RT-90 — OpenGD77 profile

**Profile id:** `opengd77-md9600`  
**Status:** Provisional — power ladder and cardinality match 1701 until validated against CPS export ([#109](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-tool/issues/109)).

## Capacity and cardinality

| Constraint | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Max channels | 1023 | Same wire format as 1701 |
| Zone members | 80 | `Channel1`…`Channel80` |
| TG list members | 32 | `Contact1`…`Contact32` |

## Power ladder (P-index → percent)

Top step is band-dependent on hardware (40 W UHF / 50 W VHF); both map to 100% internally.

| Wire | Approx. watts | Percent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `P8` | 40–50 W | 100 |
| `P7` | 25 W | 60 |
| `P6` | 10 W | 40 |
| `P5` | 5 W | 20 |
| `P4` | 2 W | 8 |
| `P3` | 1 W | 4 |
| `P2` | 500 mW | 2 |
| `P1` | 100 mW | 1 |
| `Master` | radio default | `null` |
