# OpenGD77 — Contacts.csv

Generic column reference for `Contacts.csv`. One file holds both **group talk groups** and **private contacts**; the app splits rows by `ID Type` at import and merges back on export.

**Code:** [`columns.ts`](../../../src/lib/import/opengd77/columns.ts) · [`parse.ts`](../../../src/lib/import/opengd77/parse.ts) · [`serialise.ts`](../../../src/lib/export/opengd77/serialise.ts)

## Required headers (app import)

| Header | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `Contact Name` | Identity; rows without a name are skipped |
| `ID` | DMR ID |
| `ID Type` | Determines talk group vs private contact split |

`TS Override` is optional — empty if absent.

## Column reference

| Vendor header | Internal field | Required (import) | Import rule | Export rule | Round-trip | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Contact Name` | `TalkGroup.name` or `Contact.name` | **Yes** | Trim; skip row if empty | As stored | String pass-through | FK target for Channels and TG_Lists |
| `ID` | `.number` | **Yes** | Trim | As stored | String pass-through | DMR ID integer as string |
| `ID Type` | (entity kind) | **Yes** | `Group` (case-insensitive) → `TalkGroup`; else → `Contact` | `Group` / `Private` | Lossless split | CPS values: `Group`, `Private` |
| `TS Override` | `.timeslotOverride` | No | Trim | As stored | String pass-through | `1`, `2`, or `Disabled` — CPS slot hint |

## Split semantics

| `ID Type` | Internal model | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Group` | `TalkGroup` | TX/RX talk groups referenced by `Channels.Contact` and TG list members |
| `Private` | `Contact` | Individual DMR IDs |

Export order: all talk groups first, then private contacts (order within each group follows codeplug array order).

## Naming conventions

One TG ID may appear as **two contacts** with timeslot suffixes in the name (e.g. `Scotland TS1`, `Scotland TS2`) — CPS uses separate names per slot.

Member names in `TG_Lists.csv` reference `Contact Name` here — group and private names both resolve.
