# OpenGD77 — TG_Lists.csv

Generic column reference for `TG_Lists.csv` (promiscuous RX group lists). Member column count is radio-profile-specific — see [radios/baofeng-1701.md](radios/baofeng-1701.md).

**Code:** [`columns.ts`](../../../src/lib/import/opengd77/columns.ts) (`rxGroupListMemberHeaders`) · [`parse.ts`](../../../src/lib/import/opengd77/parse.ts) · [`serialise.ts`](../../../src/lib/export/opengd77/serialise.ts)

## Wire pattern

| Pattern | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `TG List Name` | List display name; referenced by `Channels.TG List` |
| `Contact1` … `ContactN` | Member contact names (group talk groups and/or private contacts) |

Empty trailing member cells are allowed.

## Column reference

| Vendor header | Internal field | Required (import) | Import rule | Export rule | Round-trip | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TG List Name` | `RxGroupList.name` | **Yes** | Trim; skip row if empty | As stored | String pass-through | FK from `Channels.TG List` |
| `Contact1`…`ContactN` | `RxGroupList.sourceMemberNames[]` | No | Collect non-empty cells in column order; any `Contact\d+` header | Pad into `Contact1`…`ContactN` up to profile cap | Lossless names | Members are **vendor names** from Contacts.csv |

## Promiscuous RX semantics

OpenGD77 uses TG lists for **promiscuous receive** on digital channels:

- **TX talk group:** set `Channels.Contact` to the desired TX contact name.
- **Promiscuous RX:** set `Channels.TG List` to a list name; list members define which talk groups the radio listens for on that channel.
- Typical pattern: set `Contact` **or** use `TG List` for RX-heavy repeater channels — see [channels.md](channels.md) examples.

The app does not expand TG list membership into per-TG channel rows — one channel row per repeater/site is the lean model.

## Import / export notes

- Member names are stored as `sourceMemberNames` — not resolved to internal contact/talk-group ids (name-based FK at vendor boundary).
- Export writes members in array order into numbered contact columns.
- Names beyond the radio profile member cap are truncated at export (today: hard-coded profile cap in code).
