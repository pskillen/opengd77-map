# DM32 — Zones.csv

| Column | Internal | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `No.` | _(export only)_ | Sequential on export; excluded from round-trip diff |
| `Zone Name` | `Zone.name` | |
| `Channel Members` | `memberChannelIds` | Pipe-separated channel **wire** names; resolved via expanded name map on import |

Zone export uses `expandZoneMemberWireNames` with `expandModes: false` and DM32 talk-group expansion guards so members match flat `Channels.csv` names.
