# UK frequency bands and services

Canonical reference for band labels, MHz/kHz ranges, UI pill colours, and lookup order. Implementation in `src/lib/bands.ts` must match this table. In-app band plan: `/#/reference/band-plan`.

**Disclaimer:** For programming convenience only. Not authoritative for on-air operation. Licence class, power, geographic restrictions, and non-amateur TX prohibitions apply.

## Lookup behaviour

- Match channel **RX frequency** (or TX if RX blank) against each row’s min/max MHz (**inclusive**).
- First matching row wins (table ordered by increasing frequency).
- No per-channel lists; 60 m uses the full allocation span `5.2585 – 5.4065 MHz` (gaps between UK licence channels may still classify as 60 m).
- Unknown frequency: no pill or muted “?” styling.

NoV extensions (4 m 70.5–71.5, 2 m 146–147): inherit parent amateur band colour; ranges documented in Notes column only.

## Colour design

**One colour per band.** Adjacent bands must be obviously different at a glance. Amateur bands use the existing palette. Non-amateur services use distinct hues — broadcast LW must **not** reuse amateur 136 kHz violet.

Non-amateur pills render with an outline style in the UI (see [display-conventions.md](./display-conventions.md)).

## Categories

| Category | IDs | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `amateur` | `136khz` … `mm` | UK Ofcom amateur licence allocations |
| `broadcast` | `broadcast-lw`, `broadcast-mw`, `broadcast-sw-*`, `fm-broadcast` | LW / MW / SW / FM broadcast receive |

Export `UK_AMATEUR_BANDS`, `SERVICE_BANDS`, and `ALL_BANDS` from `src/lib/bands.ts`. Lookup uses `ALL_BANDS`; band-plan page groups by category.

## Broadcast

Coarse UK-oriented receive ranges. SW uses **gap segments** between amateur HF allocations so amateur rows still win inside their licence spans.
