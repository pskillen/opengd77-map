# CHIRP CSV reference

Authoritative reference for **CHIRP** radio memory CSV exports — one wire format among several at the import/export boundary (siblings: OpenGD77, DM32, qDMR, native YAML). CHIRP is **analogue FM/AM** oriented; DMR columns exist in the wire format but are empty on analogue exports.

**Tracking:** [codeplug-tool#103](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-tool/issues/103)

## File shape

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Files per export | **One** `.csv` per radio |
| Typical filename | `{RadioModel}_{YYYYMMDD}.csv` (e.g. `Baofeng_UV-5R Mini_20251129.csv`) |
| Delimiter | Comma |
| Frequency format | MHz, six decimal places (e.g. `145.500000`) |
| Foreign keys | None — flat channel list |

Sample fixtures: [`sample-exports/Chirp 2026-06-29/`](../../../sample-exports/Chirp%202026-06-29/) ([#101](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-tool/pull/101)).

## Two-layer model

| Layer | Location | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Generic wire format** | This directory ([channels.md](channels.md)) | Column headers, semantic mapping, conversion rules |
| **Radio profiles** | [`radios/`](radios/README.md) | Per-radio memory size, power ladder, filename conventions |

The **internal codeplug model is format-agnostic** ([data model](../../features/data-model/README.md)). CHIRP profile limits apply at **export time** when the operator picks a target radio.

## File set

| File | Reference | Import (app) | Export (app) | Modelled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `{radio}.csv` | [channels.md](channels.md) | Yes | Yes | `Channel[]` only |

No zones, contacts, talk groups, or RX group lists in CHIRP analogue exports.

## Classification (import)

`detectKind(fileName, headerRow)` in [`src/lib/import/chirp/adapter.ts`](../../../src/lib/import/chirp/adapter.ts):

| Signal | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Headers include `Location`, `Name`, `Frequency`, `Duplex`, `Mode` | `channels` |
| Otherwise | `unknown` |

## Skip vs error

| Outcome | When |
| --- | --- |
| **Recognised** | CHIRP header fingerprint matches |
| **Error** | Recognised file fails parse (empty CSV, unparseable row) |
| **Rejected (batch)** | Mixed CHIRP + OpenGD77 files when a single format is selected |

## DMR columns on analogue exports

`URCALL`, `RPT1CALL`, `RPT2CALL`, `DVCODE` are part of the CHIRP wire schema for digital-capable radios. On analogue FM exports in our fixtures they are **empty**. Import ignores them; export leaves them blank.
